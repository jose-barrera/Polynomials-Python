# Polynomials

A polynomial P(x) is a sum of monomials of the variable x. 

This project uses **object oriented paradigm** to define and implement a class that represents a polynomial and has the following:

PROPERTIES
* coefficients (read-only)
* exponents (read-only)
* degree (read-only)

METHODS
* append
* add
* substract
* multiply
* evaluate

Notes:

1. This class keeps a simplified collection of monomials, sorted from largest to smallest degree.
2. It has alwyas at least one monomial, even when its value is zero.
